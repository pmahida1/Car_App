What is the data that is stored locally in SQLite DB?
In this Application, I stored the Cars data manually in the SQLite DB model named "CarModel" and on the Home Page we show all the Data that store in the Model named "CarModel".
and for the Fav Page, we created the Model Named "FavCarsModel" we save all the Favorite cars in this model using SQLite DB and after that, we show the Favorite cars on the page 
Named "Favorite Cars". Fav Page = Favorite.
